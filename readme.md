## Objective

By default, Apache KafkaÂ® communicates in <abbr>PLAINTEXT</abbr>, which means that all data is sent in the clear. To encrypt communication, you should configure all the Kafka to use <abbr>SSL</abbr> encryption.

This quick guide show the configuration setup to set configuration settings to enforce SSL. Initially I will have a script for a local installation of Kafka to be installed. Then i'll show how to set up a full Terraform & Ansible cluster provisioned with full internode communication.

## Local_Setup

While you would use Terraform in combination with Ansible to orchestrate infrastructure and then application settings in Cloud, I will just use a script to install Kafka in an Ubuntu setup for this tutorial. 

`echo $hostname`

## Configuration

So, optimization considerations aside, the vanilla Kafka installation will allow for quick and dirty testing for topic creation and population. Some quick data to be input: 

`enter data injection here`
